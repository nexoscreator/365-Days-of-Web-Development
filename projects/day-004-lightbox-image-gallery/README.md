# Day 004: Lightbox Image Gallery

## Project Description

This project implements a responsive lightbox image gallery. Users can click on thumbnail images to view them in a larger, overlay lightbox. The lightbox includes navigation controls to move between images, as well as a close button to exit the lightbox view.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## Features

- Responsive grid layout for thumbnail images
- Smooth transition effects when opening and closing the lightbox
- Navigation controls (previous and next buttons) in the lightbox
- Close button to exit the lightbox view
- Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys and Esc key)
- Automatic image sizing to fit the viewport

## Challenges Faced

1. Implementing smooth transitions between images in the lightbox
2. Ensuring responsive design for both the thumbnail grid and the lightbox view
3. Handling various image aspect ratios while maintaining a consistent layout
4. Implementing keyboard navigation in addition to click events

## Lessons Learned

- Advanced CSS transitions and transforms for creating smooth visual effects
- Techniques for creating an overlay effect with CSS and JavaScript
- Handling keyboard events for improved accessibility and user experience
- Managing image loading and error states in JavaScript

## Future Improvements

- Add touch swipe support for mobile devices
- Implement image lazy loading for better performance with large galleries
- Add zoom functionality for detailed image viewing
- Create a slideshow mode with autoplay feature
- Implement caption support for images
