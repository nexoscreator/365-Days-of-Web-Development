# Day 02: Creating a Toast Notification

This project is part of the **365 Days of Web Development** series, where we build small projects every day to improve our development skills. On Day 2, we implement a simple toast notification system in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Simple toast notifications that appear on button clicks
- **Customizable Toasts**: Toasts can display different types of messages, such as success, information, danger, or warning.
- **Accessible Design**: The notifications include aria-live attributes, which ensure they are announced by screen readers.
- **Notifications Duration**: Notifications auto-dismiss after 3 seconds.
- **Smooth Animations**: Each toast fades in and out with a smooth transition.
