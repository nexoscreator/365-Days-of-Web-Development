# 365 Days of Web Development

Welcome to my **365 Days of Web Development** challenge! In this repository, I'm creating a new web development project every day for a year. Each project is designed to showcase different web technologies and improve my skills as a developer.

## Project Structure

- `/projects`: Contains all the daily projects
